# Indian-Traffic-Signs-Prediction
This is a multi-class classification project where the aim is to accurately label a mobile captured image of an Indian traffic sign.

## Motivation
India has so many different types of traffic signs out there (85 to be precise), each with different colours, shapes and sizes. Sometimes, there are two signs may have a similar colour, shape and size, but have 2 totally different meanings. Also all countries have there respective set of traffic signs. How on earth would humans ever be able to correctly classify a traffic sign on the road in India? We can do this by creating our very own CNN to classify each different road sign for us.

## Build Status
The classifier model is completed and works well. The model is trained using a total of 7210 images and have achieved accuracy of 75.75%.
